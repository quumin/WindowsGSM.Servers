This repository contains the updated plugin for running the **Satisfactory Dedicated Server** via **WindowsGSM**. The original plugin was created by [werewolf2150 and caindrac](https://github.com/werewolf2150/WindowsGSM.Satisfactory), and this updated version includes several fixes and improvements to address issues with the server freezing and improve compatibility with WindowsGSM.

While it worked for earlier versions of Satisfactory, recent updates in WindowsGSM and changes in the game server required adjustments to the plugin code.
